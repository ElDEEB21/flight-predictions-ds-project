# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Flight Price Prediction** project! This initiative aims to predict flight prices using machine learning models, leveraging various flight-related factors to build a robust and accurate model. The project is part of the prestigious **Digital Egyptian Pioneer Initiative (DEPI)** under the **IBM Data Science Track**.

### 🚀 Project Overview
By analyzing flight data and applying machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide insights for both **travelers** and **airlines** to better understand flight pricing. This will be achieved through a full data science pipeline, from **data cleaning** to **model deployment**.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset provides detailed flight information to fuel the prediction model, including:
- ✈️ **Airline**: Airline operating the flight.
- 🌍 **Source City**: City from which the flight departs.
- 🕓 **Departure Time**: Scheduled departure time (morning, evening, etc.).
- 🛑 **Stops**: Number of stops (non-stop, 1 stop, 2+ stops).
- 🕗 **Arrival Time**: Scheduled arrival time.
- 🌆 **Destination City**: City where the flight lands.
- 💺 **Class**: Travel class (economy, business).
- ⏱️ **Duration**: Flight duration (in hours).
- 📅 **Days Left**: Number of days until departure.
- 💵 **Price**: Price of the flight (in INR).

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates flight prices using the dataset's features, offering valuable insights for both passengers and airlines. The process follows a complete **data science pipeline**, starting from data cleaning and ending with model deployment.

## 🛠️ Stage 1: Data Cleaning
The dataset was meticulously cleaned to prepare it for analysis and modeling. Key actions included:
1. 🔄 **Column Renaming**: Renamed columns to be more descriptive (e.g., `source_city` to `Departure City`).
2. 🔢 **Numeric Conversion**: Converted categorical columns like `stops` to numerical values.
3. 💱 **Currency Conversion**: Converted the `price` column from INR to USD using a fixed conversion rate.
4. 🧹 **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Removed irrelevant columns like `flight` and `Unnamed: 0`.

## 📊 Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about the dataset and its features. Visualizations helped reveal key relationships:

### Key Insights:
- 📍 **Airline & City Distribution**: Certain airlines dominate, and many flights originate from key cities.
- 💸 **Price & Flight Duration**: A strong correlation between flight duration, number of stops, and price.
- 💼 **Class & Price**: Business class is significantly more expensive than economy.
- 🕒 **Time of Departure**: Departure time influences the price, with some times being costlier than others.

## 🛠️ Stage 3: Feature Engineering

In this stage, I transformed the raw data to make it suitable for machine learning.

### Key Steps:
- 🔄 **One-Hot Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables like 'Airline', 'City', and 'Flight Class' into numerical features.
- 📏 **Feature Scaling**: Scaled continuous variables such as 'Duration' and 'Days Left' using `StandardScaler`.
- 🔍 **Correlation Analysis**: Generated a correlation matrix to identify the most influential features.
- ✂️ **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for evaluation.
